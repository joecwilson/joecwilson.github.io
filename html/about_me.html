        Hi, I'm Joseph Wilson, a member of the class of 2026 at UT Austin. My main programming hobbies
        are android development and a bit of web development. Outside of programming 3D, modeling and
        video games interest me.
    </p>
    <p>
        The main reason I got into android development was embarrassingly simple, just having knowledge of
        java and an android phone, and a problem that needed fixing. Of course, these problems could have
        probably been fixed by spending 30 minutes on the app store, instead of tens of hours of programming
        and tearing out hair. But what is the fun in that, why not do it yourself and make something you are
        proud of and can place on your resume. But if you looked around in the source code of my android
        projects you would find that I actually use Kotlin instead of Java. This happened because tutorials
        in Kotlin were more plentiful, and features like coroutines were not available in Java. Just something
        that happened while exploring the world of programming.
    </p>
